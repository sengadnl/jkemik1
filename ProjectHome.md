The goal is to form a loop of adjacent dots around the opponent's dots. A complete loop of adjacent dots that contains the other player's dots is considered a capture or cell, and the number of captured dots are counted as points for the capturing player or the player who own's the loop.

A cell can also be captured and provide a greater advantage to the capturing player. Visit the [Rules](Rules.md) page for more detail.

A Game ends when one player reaches the consensual maximum score. In a game players aim to reach the **maximum score**.
