==A. Play==

  * *One Dot play* 

    Players can only place one dot during their turn.

  * *Adjacent dot capture* 

     Dots are placed where the grid lines intersect with each other, a valid capture should only be formed by adjacent *Dots*. Two *Dots* are adjacent if and only if they are located on the same board square.

  * *Nonempty Capture* 

    A capture consists of a loop of adjacent *Dots*, as defined in the second rule. These *Dots* must form a wall around one or more of the opponent's *Dots*. Therefore, a Cell can also be captured.

See the [GetStarted StartGuide] for details on how to run the application.

==B. Scoring==

 * *Dot Rule*: One point is earned for every captured *Dot*. 1 *Dot* = 1 Point
 * *Cell Value Rule*: The value of a captured Cell equates the number of captured points within itself. Therefore the value of this *Cell* is also subtracted from the score of its former owner. 
 * *Cell Wall Rule*: *Dots* that make the building blocks of a captured cell are counted as captured *Dots* for the player who is capturing the cell.
 * *Empty Cell Rule*: An empty capture is invalid 
 
      SCORING FORMULA

      Supposed: 
         * D the sum of captured *Dots*.
         * C the Sum of captured *Cell* values.

          _SCORE = D + C_
