= RULES =

*One dot play* 

Players can only place on dot during their turn.

*Adjacent dot capture* 

Dots are placed where the grid lines intersect with each other, a valid capture should only be form by connecting adjacent dots. Two dots are adjacent if and only if they are located on the same scare on the grid.

*Nonempty Capture* 

A capture consists of a loop of adjacent dot, as defined in the second rule. These dots must form a wall around one or more of the opponent's dots. Therefore, a cell can also be captured.
