= RULES =

*Rule one*: _One dot play_ 

Players can only place on dot during their turn.

*Rule two*: _Adjacent dot capture_ 

Dots are placed where the grid lines intersect with each other, a valid capture should only be form by connecting adjacent dots. Two dots are adjacent if and only if they are located on the same scare on the grid.

*Rule three*: _Nonempty Capture_ 

A capture consists of a loop of adjacent dot, as defined in the second rule. These dots must form a wall around one or more of the opponent's dots. Therefore, a cell can also be captured.
