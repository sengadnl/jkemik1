 * On start, the application is in Game configuration mode. To start a game click on *NEW* in the main view and use the Jkemik Dashboard illustrated in the above image to customize the game. Simply click on what you want the change.

On the *Dashboard*: 

  # Players can decide on a aboard _theme_. 
  # They can select their respective _colors_. 
  # They can decide on the _grid size_.
  # They can register their _names_. 
 * Once satisfied with the new game settings, a click on the *SAVE* button will initiates the game.

 * Use the *OPTION* button in the main view to change other game settings.
   * *Max Win*: Sets the maximum score. The player who reaches this score wins the game.
   * *Auto Capture*: Turns automatic capture on.
   * *Auto Pass Turn*: Turns automatic turn switching.

==Exiting the game==
 * Use the *EXIT* button from the main view to exit the application.

===ATTENTION:===

*_The currently implementation of JKemik does nod restrict a player from playing for his opponent. Therefore switching turns relies on players integrity. I will hopefully come up with a remedy to this issue at some point._
