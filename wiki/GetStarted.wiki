   * *Max Win*: Sets the maximum score. The first player to reach this score wins the game.

===ATTENTION:===

*_The currently implementation of JKemik does nod restrict a player from playing for his opponent. Therefore switching turns relies on players integrity. I will hopefully come up with a remedy to this issue at some point._
