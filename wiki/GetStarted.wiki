 * Use the *OPTION* button in the main view to change other game settings.
   * *Max Win*: Sets the maximum score. The player who reaches this score first wins the game.
   * *Auto Capture*: Turns automatic capture on.
   * *Auto Turn Pass*: Turns automatic turn switching.

==Exiting the game==
 * Use the *EXIT* button from the main view to exit the application.

*_When turn passing is set to automatic there currently is no way of restricting a player from playing for his opponent. Therefore switching turns relies on players integrity. You can always turn auto pass off as a remedy._
